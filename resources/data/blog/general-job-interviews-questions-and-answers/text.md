## Tell me about yourself

> https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/tell-me-about-yourself-software-engineer

I'm an experienced software engineer. I've been programming for almost 12 years (since 2010), 
and I've almost 6 years of experience developing enterprise-level solutions.

I've created several large projects completely by myself from scratch.
I've experienced in both backend and frontend development using modern approaches.

While working in Digital Security as a Lead Software Engineer,
I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, 
I'm able to understand business value. I also have experience in team management.

Before my last position, I was a full-stack (mostly PHP) software developer, and an entrepreneur at the same time 
for several years. It gave me self-discipline and stress-resistance and the ability to work remotely effectively.
I've learnt what is responsibility, how to clearly convey thoughts.

In the next 10 years, I'd like to move into a Chief Technology Officer role. 
A position like this would let me gain more experience with project management and leadership.

## How would you describe yourself?

> https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/interview-question-how-would-you-describe-yourself

I'm passionate about my work. I enjoy working on a product to make it better.
I love solving problems. Solving problems is my second nature.

Iâ€™m always looking for an opportunity to do better things, to become smarter than before, to achieve goals.
In my previous role, I was promoted three times in less than two years.

I'm also good at communication because I always try to eliminate any ambiguity. 
I always give enough information to others to be understood correctly.

## What makes you unique?

I have a bunch of positive personal qualities that might be useful for this role:

**supportive, helpful and collaborative**

No one can say anything bad about me. Every person I have been working with is thankful to me, 
because I'm a good team player and also I'm a very supportive, helpful and collaborative guy.

**hardworking, entrepreneurial**

I'm growth-focused and unafraid of challenges. I'm very passionate about learning new things and mastering old skills.

**problem-solver, reliable**

I really can say from my experience that I'm a good problem solver.
I always dig problems deep, explain things well, do my work thoroughly and carefully.

> The process of building product's knowledge base used to require two people (one analyst and one programmer) and two days.
> After my automatizations, it takes less than a day and only one analyst.

> I was in charge of making the product releases. It happened every month and this process consists of multiple stages 
> like building the product, packaging it, uploading, testing, writing news, and much more.
> There were lots of manual work and undocumented things. 
> So I created a fully fledged documentation for the entire process and automated it even more. 
> I decreased the time this process consume two times at least.

> These products were tightly coupled, and it was an unhealthy connection between them I might say.
> I severely decreased that connection between the two products.
