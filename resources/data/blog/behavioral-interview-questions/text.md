Behavioral interviews are the third type of interviews (after coding and systems design)
that assess you on nuances of how you can settle conflicts, handle stress, communicate with a team,
how you able to overcome hard situations and so on and so forth.

Qualities to assess:
- Humility.
- Respect.
- Being a good team player.
- Being able to work under pressure.
- Being able to handle conflicts.
- Learn from mistakes.
- Being initiative.
- Leadership.

What to avoid:
- To be disrespectful, mean, arrogant, offensive, confrontational. Or to show these qualities of yours during 
storytelling.
- Being to vague in answers. It's better to give more details than less.

Mix things that show how you're amazing, initiative, smart (personal qualities), etc, with things that
show how well you as a part of a team (team player's qualities).

It's totally fine if you want to tweak some details in your experience, not in sake of
lying but in sake of removing unnecessary details, polishing sharp edges, highlighting important details, etc.

If you asked about some experience you don't have, you may say something like 
"I haven't had some experience like that, but this is what I would do if that happened to me...".

Be not too vague, not too short, and not throw too many details, don't ramble from topic to topic.

## Low performer

> Imagine you had a low performer on your team. How would you handle the situation? 
> What would you do to help them?

It needs to ask for clarification what does it actually mean. Why they're low performers?
Do they do too few bug fixes? Do they have too few features done? Do they leave many bugs after?
Do they have failed at something once, or do they fail repeatedly doing the same mistakes?

It also needs to clarify what causes these faults. You need to identify the issue. Identify the cause of 
low performance. Maybe tasks are too hard for they level? Maybe some external dependencies block they?

If we determined that they are low performers indeed, then the simplest way is to help him. 
Give him constructive feedback. Be available to answer questions. Document their succeeded and failed efforts of 
improving performance over a time. Gather feedback from the rest of a team.

Only if you did your best to handle this situation then delegate this problem to the manager.

## Team conflict

> Describe a time when there was a conflict within your team. How did you help resolve the conflict? 
> Did you do anything to prevent it in the future?

Try to find good intents in actions of conflicted people. Try to find common ground with each side.
Communication is the key to success in preventing and settling down such situations.

## Interest in company

> Why do you want to work at ...?

- The excited stack of technology.
- Company specific features.
- 

to be done.

## Strong disagreement

> Describe a time when you strongly disagreed with a coworker about an engineering decision.
> How did you go about making the final decision? What did you do after the decision was made?

Approximate algorithm to tackle this:
- Try to dig deep. To really understand all the ideas your opponent has. Why they came to the conclusion that hey came to?
- Then try to overview, look at the ideas from a higher level. From project or company level, for example.
- If once the decision was made, then commit to it and follow it like it was your decision.
- Remember: don't attack people, attack their ideas, but be respectful.

## Sudden onboarding

> Imagine you and your team are in the middle of a major project at work, with many moving parts, complicated context,
> a lot of work, etc.. A new software engineer joins your team, and you're tasked with onboarding them.
> What would you do?

- Have a proper documentation in place.
- Make myself 99.9% available to this new engineer for answering questions they have.
- Carefully pick very-very simple bugs to start with. Then give it a couple tasks larger. Then again.
It shouldn't be critical parts of the project. The main idea is to let the new teammate get used to the code base.  

to be done.

## Work distribution

> How would you go about distributing work for a project across a team of software engineers?
> If you've led a project in the past, describe what you did.

to be done.

## Past mistake

> Describe a time when you made a mistake. How did you deal with the repercussions of the mistake?
> What lessons did you learn from the mistake?

to be done.

- Netcat exchange module: inconsistency of the result with the technical task.
- How I deleted alifba.

## Challenging project

> Describe a challenging project that you worked on. Why was it challenging? What was your role in the project?
> How did you deal with the various difficulties of the project?

to be done.

- Multiprocessing multistep oktarget task execution system.

## Production outage

> Describe a time when you had to deal with an outage at work. How did you handle the situation?
> What steps did you take after the issue was resolved?

to be done.

## Tough feedback

> How do you think about receiving and giving feedback? Describe a time when you received tough feedback and/or 
> a time when you gave tough feedback. How did you react to it? How did you give it?

to be done.

- Not for a person, but for a system module: netcat cms integration tools.

## Strengths and improvements

> What aspects of software engineering do you think you're very good at? What about areas where you'd like to improve?
> How do you plan on improving?

to be done.

## Comfort zone

> Describe a time when you went out of your comfort zone. Why did you do it?
> What lessons did you learn from the experience?
