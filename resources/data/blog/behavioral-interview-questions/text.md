Behavioral interviews are the third type of interviews (after coding and systems design)
that assess you on nuances of how you can settle conflicts, handle stress, communicate with a team,
how you able to overcome hard situations and so on and so forth.

Qualities to assess:
- Humility.
- Respect.
- Being a good team player.
- Being able to work under pressure.
- Being able to handle conflicts.
- Learn from mistakes.
- Being initiative.
- Leadership.

What to avoid:
- To be disrespectful, mean, arrogant, offensive, confrontational. Or to show these qualities of yours during 
storytelling.
- Being to vague in answers. It's better to give more details than less.

Mix things that show how you're amazing, initiative, smart (personal qualities), etc, with things that
show how well you as a part of a team (team player's qualities).

It's totally fine if you want to tweak some details in your experience, not in sake of
lying but in sake of removing unnecessary details, polishing sharp edges, highlighting important details, etc.

If you asked about some experience you don't have, you may say something like 
"I haven't had some experience like that, but this is what I would do if that happened to me...".

Be not too vague, not too short, and not throw too many details, don't ramble from topic to topic.
