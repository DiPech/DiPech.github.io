**Data Structures** are a way of organizing and managing data. Any data structure consists of:
- Pieces of data.
- Relations between them.
- Operations you might perform on them.

Every algorithm represents a solution for some problem. Most problems can have more that one solution.
We analyze these solutions using **time** and **space** complexity analysis. It shows how fast is our solution, or 
how much memory a solution takes.
