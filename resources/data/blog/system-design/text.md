## Common questions to ask

**Can you split the entire system into separate, distinguishable components?**

If so, design them separately.

**How much data can be in the system?**

**How many users will be using the system?**

**What availability level should be presented?**

In other words, how many "nines" of availability you need to provide.

**How fast the system must be?**

**How large the system must be? Is it distributes across the world?**

**Is it an internal system?**

If so, then you probably donâ€™t want to achieve super high-availability, 2-3 nones might be enough.
