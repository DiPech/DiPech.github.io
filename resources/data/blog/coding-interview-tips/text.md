## You as a good coder

- Name your variables, functions, methods descriptively. For instance, extract conditions into descriptive boolean vars.
- Extract code parts (duplicated or by logic) that can be extracted into separate functions or methods.
- If you cannot write self-descriptive code for some reason then add comments into code.
- Know your language, use common code style for this language.
- Be able to test your code, provide test cases, handle corner cases.

## You as a good problem solver

- Eliminate ambiguity. It's very important to ask as many clarifying questions as you can to achieve clarity.
"What kind of input can I get? Should I handle this particular case? Is it okay if we use this tool?".
Never jump into code right after receiving a problem.
- Take some time to discover the problem. Consider alternatives thoroughly. Consider props and cons. Analyse approximate 
space and time complexity. How you can improve it? Can we split the problem into subproblems?
- Discuss trade-offs of current solution. Maybe it consumes more memory, but faster. Or maybe the solution
uses recursion, and you may want to underline that you probably don't want use it in production-grade code, but for now
it gives us a very smart and elegant solution in 3 lines of code.
- Start from the highest level. Declare (but not implement for now) necessary classes, helper methods, functions. 
Implement these less important parts later. Start implementing by solving the main problem, then implement
the rest if you have time for that.
- Test your solution, especially for edge cases. Provide test cases. Discuss it with the interviewees.

## You as a person with good communication skills

- Gather as much information as you can.
- Voice your thoughts, don't be silent for a long period.
