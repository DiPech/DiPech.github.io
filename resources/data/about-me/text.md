Hi, my name is Dmitry! I'm {{ ages }} years old. Currently, I live in Saint-Petersburg â€“ 
a lovely city situated on the Neva river.

I love technology, programming, gadgets. I like to create useful and interesting software.

If I did not become a developer, I would become a physicist, because our world is a place of unrevealed secrets.

I have a wonderful wife, and a funny cat :)
