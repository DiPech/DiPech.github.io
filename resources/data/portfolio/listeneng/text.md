This is a web service for studying english. I built it for myself.

**Key features:**
* Sections: Every section consists of subsections and may have Entries.
* Entry: It may be one of three types â€“ PhraseAndTranslation,  or Divider.
  * Phrase And Translation: The main type, you can specify any word/phrase/sentence you want and translation for it.
  * Text: It's possible to specify some grammar rules here.
  * Divider: All the entities after a divider will be under a collapsible block.
* Two modes:
  * View mode: For studying.
  * Edit mode: For managing all the sections and entries you have.
* Two studying modes:
  * Listen: It plays Translation in russian, then pause 10 seconds, then Phrase in english, then pause 2 seconds.
  * Cards: Nothing other than just common flashcards mode.
* Other features:
  * CRUD (multiple entities at one request).
  * TextToSpeech.
  * Translate en-US to ru-RU and vice versa while editing.
  * Drag&Drop Entries reordering, even between multiple sections.
  * Adaptive design.
  * Import/Export the data.
  * Dark Mode.

The main idea is to listen a phase in russian, then immediately try to translate it into english phrase.
It allows automating grammar rules usage and helps to improve vocabulary.
