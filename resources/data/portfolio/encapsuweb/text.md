It's an application for macOS that allows you to create other native macOS applications which shows you chosen website and allows code (HTML, CSS, JS) injection.

For example, you can create an application named "Google Docs", hide with JS or CSS unnecessary page parts and use it like a native Google Docs application.  

Or you can append some additional controls over a page and script some automation by imitating clicks, typings and mouse pointer movements.
For example: I've created a script which constantly re-send rejected ads for moderation.
